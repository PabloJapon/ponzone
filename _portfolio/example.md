Adria's statement:

"I absolutely rate my experience with Dark Owl to have been perfect. Â Since the first day, Rafa and his team grabbed me by the hand to make this journey easy and enjoyable. There were a lot of things to do, but he made sure that everything was taken care of. Rafa also took care of me until the moment I met my coach and teammates. Even after I was settled, he was making sure I was alright. A real, true agent".
